👉VoiceChat Using GPT3 
<br>👉Version 1. (More features and UI will be fixed on the later relesed version)</br>
<br>🗣️This is a simple web based VoiceChat client that uses Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) engine.</br>
<br>This script is a Python web server that provides a chatbot service using the OpenAI API. It allows users to communicate with the chatbot using their voice through a web browser. When the user clicks a button on the web page, their microphone is activated, and their voice is recorded. The recorded audio is then sent to the server as a POST request, and the server generates a response using the OpenAI API. The response is displayed on the web page and also spoken out loud using text-to-speech. This script was created using the Flask web server framework, the OpenAI API, and the pyttsx3 and speech_recognition libraries.</br>
